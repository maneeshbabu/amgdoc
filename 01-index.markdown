In the beginning stages CLOUDPORT platform uses a limited set of metadata for channel playout. As Amagi began delivering linear channels to various MVPD platforms, there was an evolving requirements to deliver EPG and VOD content to these platforms. The additional services for VOD delivery and EPG required additional assets and metadata for processing as per various MVPD specifications. Amagi's Media Ingest Service is designed to consolidate the ingest of content and related metadata required for various platforms and services. This service will be providing easy interfaces for content partners to deliver contents to Amagi platforms and services.
