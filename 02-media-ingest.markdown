## Overview

Media Ingest Service accepts requests to setup media ingest workflow and manage change request to the workflow through an account created for the partner. The account provides access:-

* Methods of content ingest to Amagi platform

* Information about requirements - content, metadata, artwork - for various platforms for different services

* How-to and best practices for ingesting contents based on the target MVPDs

* Frequently asked questions and troubleshooting guides to help partners

### Create an account

* If you are new to Media Ingest Service, you will be added to the Media Ingest Service by Amagi Onboarding. 

* Currently, there is no Amagi-wide customer portal service, so a new account will be created by Onboarding.

* [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira) is used for managing accounts.

* When a new account is created, additional information will be sent as an email.

### Create a channel

* You can create a request in Jira to add a new account to Asset Ingest Service.
* After creation, you will have to select an ingest method from the list of methods provided as part of the guide.
* Based on the selected ingest method, the timeline for provisioning will be provided by the Service team.
* Communication of the request will be facilitated through Jira. There should be a conscious effort to minimize or avoid entirely the meetings 
  to discuss requirements and workflow.
* Jira requests can be received over email also. Jira email handler will be added to create and update Jira tickets from emails.

### Change request
* In order to raise change requests, you can use Jira for raising tickets.
* New account creation will also be served through Jira.
* Change request communication will be handled through Jira tickets. Timeline for provisioning will be provided by the Service team.

### Operational Phase
* You will be provided with an interface for ingesting assets and metadata to Amagi Asset Ingest Service without needing involvement of Amagi 
  personnel.
* Alerts and notifications will be provided to the customer.

### Ad-hoc requests
* No ad-hoc request to make changes is planned to be entertained during the operational phase. 
* Amagi operationsâ€™ role is limited to Infra monitoring of the service
* Change requests are accepted through Jira
* In case of issues with usage, Amagi Operations will be providing guidance as per defined SOP
