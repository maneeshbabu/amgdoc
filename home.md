Amagi CLOUDPORT platform enables TV Channels, Broadcasters and Digital TV platforms to run TV Channels on cloud. Amagi has been delivering linear channels to an increasing number of MVPD/Streaming TV platforms and traditional Broadcasting networks. As these platforms and networks have been increasing, there is a growing demand to provide additional services to deliver EPG and VOD content to these platforms and networks. The additional services for VOD delivery and EPG require additional assets (artwork) and metadata for processing as per various MVPD specifications. So there is a need for ingesting a set of contents and metadata that are common to all services, and also a set of contents and metadata that are used by specific services. This led to additional effort for Amagi and our partners to provide required content and metadata for all services. Amagi's Media DataBase is designed to consolidate the ingest of content and related metadata required for all services - CLOUDPORT, EPG, VOD. This service will be providing different interfaces for content partners to deliver contents and metadata to Amagi Media DataBase.

The media ingest service integrates contents and metadata delivery methods for different Amagi services like CLOUDPORT, EPG, VoD and Analytics. The media ingest service offers different methods to choose for ingesting to Amagi Media Store. The service is continously integrating different methods based on new requirements from content partners, channels and networks. Amagi EPG and VOD services are adding support for more MVPDs and the additional requirements from these platforms will be integrated to the media ingest service.
