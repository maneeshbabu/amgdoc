# Ratings
<p align="justify">
Many of the MVPDs prefer to receive rating information for the scheduled programs as part of the metadata. These ratings vary as per the rating bodies in various countries. Hence the platforms may require ratings to be specified according to the country in which the stream is broadcast.

This document captures the various specifications for the Ratings, including the allowed values for the various MVPDs to which these values are delivered.
